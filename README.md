> **Research Question:** Can pneumatic-electric hybrids compete with pure BEV in urban micro-mobility?  
> **Answer:** No. HEPV consumes 11.08% MORE energy than baseline BEV.

**Why this matters:**
- ✅ Prevents future resource waste on unviable technologies
- ✅ Demonstrates scientific integrity (transparent negative results)
- ✅ Open-source validated models for community use
